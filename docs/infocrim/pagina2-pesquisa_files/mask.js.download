/* NOTE: THE FIRST 2 ARGUMENTS SHOULD ALWAYS REMAIN THE SAME - this.value, this */
// the first argument in the function, accepts the "value" of the textbox to be masked
// the second argument is the name of the textbox 
	//although the first 2 could have been done in 1 argument I did it in 2
	// to make it easier to understand

//the third argument holds the locations of the separator,
// each location should be separated by a comma - (going from lower numbers to higher)

//the fourth holds the delimiter (or separator) character.

/* nothing in the function should be edited,
	to change a delimiter or character location,
	change it in the calling script
	- the following code should be inserted into the field(s) to be masked - */
	
		/*replace 'location1,location2' with the locations where you want the delimiter
			replace the 'delimiter' with the separating character you would like */
